        <p>Welcome to my Page!</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Hi there! as an IT student, I am pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and have a strong interest in technology and how it can be utilized to resolve complicated issues and enhance people's lives. My studies have provided me with a solid base in programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++, as well as a broad understanding of various computer science concepts, including algorithms, data structures, and databases. I have also completed several projects that demonstrate my abilities and knowledge, including a web application built using React and Node.js to help users find nearby volunteer opportunities, and a database management system designed for a small business. In my leisure time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and staying up to date with the latest industry trends. Additionally, I am a member of a local coding club and enjoy working with other students on projects. I am eager to continue expanding my skills and putting my knowledge into practice in the real world.</p>

                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p>Programming refers to a technological process for telling a computer which tasks to perform in order to solve problems. You can think of programming as a collaboration between humans and computers, in which humans create instructions for a computer to follow (code) in a language computers can understand.</p>
